Storybook is like a workshop for building and showcasing the different parts of a website or app. Imagine you're designing a car. Instead of putting all the parts together and hoping they work, you can lay out each part separately on a table, examine them closely, and make sure they're perfect before assembling the whole car. That's what Storybook does for web development. It helps developers create and test individual components, like buttons, input fields, or menus, in isolation from the rest of the project. This way, they can make sure each piece works as expected before putting them all together in the final product. It's like building with Lego bricks, where you make sure each brick fits and functions correctly before building the entire structure.
